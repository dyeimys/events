Each layer has its own responsibilities and concerns, following the separation of concerns principle. The packages are organized as follows:

- `application`: contains the use cases, which represents the application's business rules. This layer uses DTOs to transfer data between layers and mappers to convert between DTOs and entities.
- `domain`: contains the entities, which represent the business domain concepts, and the enums and exceptions used by the domain.
- `infrastructure`: contains the implementations of the interfaces defined by the `application` and `domain` layers. In this project, it contains the persistence and Kafka implementations.
- `presentation`: contains the web controllers and their DTOs and mappers. The controllers receive the requests, use the `application` layer to perform the business logic, and return the responses to the client.
